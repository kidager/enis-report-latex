- __What is this?__

  This a ready to use Latex template specific for ENIS student.
  It generate a PDF with all the requirements for a graduation report as defined on the website.

- __How can I use it?__

  Well, I'm using it on linux (debian to be specific), I haven't got the time to test it on other operating systems.

- __Any specific requirements?__

  Yes actually, to be able to "build" this report, you will need to have `GNU Make` and `pdflatex` and `bibtex` installed on your computer.
  You will also need a PDF viewer to be able to open the generated PDF file.

- __Can I contribute?__

  Every change is more than welcome, if you have any improvement you want to add, make a pull request at https://github.com/kidager/enis-report-latex
  Or you can just fork the repository and do whatever you want with it.

- __Credits?__

  This took me almost two months to build (I knew nothing about latex, I learnt it in the process).
  So any credit is welcome, but you are free to use this however suits you.
  `Just keep in mind, use it at your own risk!`
